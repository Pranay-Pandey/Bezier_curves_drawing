  <h2>Requirements</h2>
  <p>The script requires the following dependencies:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>NumPy</li>
    <li>Matplotlib</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Installation</h2>
  <p>To install the dependencies, run the following command:</p>
<code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>

  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <p>To use the script, simply run the following command:</p>
<code>python draw_text.py</code>

  <p>The script will generate a plot of the word "DRAW" using Bezier curves.</p>
  <h2>Understanding the Code</h2>
  
  <p>
  The script uses the Bezier curve formula to generate the curves for each letter in the word "DRAW". Bezier curves are a type of mathematical curve that is commonly used in computer graphics and animation. They are named after French engineer Pierre BÃ©zier, who developed the mathematical basis for the curves while working for the car manufacturer Renault in the 1960s.

The Bezier curve formula is based on a set of control points that define the shape of the curve. The script defines eight control points for each letter, which are used to generate the curve using NumPy and Matplotlib libraries. The resulting plot shows the word "DRAW" rendered using Bezier curves.

The Bezier curve formula and its variations have a wide range of applications in computer graphics, including designing fonts, 3D modeling, and creating animations. Bezier curves are also used in other fields such as engineering and physics, where they can be used to model complex shapes and trajectories.
